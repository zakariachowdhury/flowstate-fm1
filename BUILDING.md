# Building SLOOP

The build makes three files in `build/`:

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `felucca.bin` | the firmware app |
| `loader/ota.bin` | the update loader |
| `felucca.fwsc` | the installable package (app + loader) |

## Windows (WSL)

`INSTALL-SLOOP.bat` builds in a WSL distribution and opens the installer on
`http://localhost:8766/webapp/installer/`. It needs Python 3 with Pillow on Windows, a WSL
distribution with the JieLi toolchain, and the three SDK files (below) in `build/deps/ac79`.
Set `SLOOP_WSL_DISTRO` (default `Ubuntu`) and `SLOOP_TOOLCHAIN` (a Linux path, default
`/root/.jieli/toolchain`) if yours differ.

## Prerequisites (macOS)

`tools/setup-macos.sh` checks all of this and installs what is missing (the toolchain, the SDK
files, the container image); it is safe to run again. Details, pinned versions and troubleshooting:
[docs/macos-development.md](docs/macos-development.md).

- Python 3 with Pillow: `pip3 install Pillow`
- Docker Desktop. The JieLi toolchain is Linux x86-64 only; the build runs each tool in a
  `linux/amd64` `debian:bookworm-slim` container (Rosetta on Apple silicon). Keep the source
  tree in a folder Docker can share, e.g. under `/Users`.
- The JieLi Linux toolchain (clang 4.0.1 for pi32v2, from JieLi's package server):

  ```
  tools/get_toolchain.sh            # installs to ~/.jieli/toolchain (pinned, SHA-256 checked)
  ```

- The JieLi AC79 SDK (Apache-2.0). The package uses three of its files
  (`cpu/wl82/tools/uboot.boot`, `cfg_tool.bin`, `cfg/eq_cfg_hw.bin`); they are not part of this tree.

  ```
  git clone --depth 1 --branch AC79NN_SDK_V1.2.1_2023-12-13 \
      https://gitee.com/Jieli-Tech/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK.git ~/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK
  ```

  or only the three files, checked against `tools/build.py`: `tools/fetch_sdk.py`

- Node.js (optional, for the web tests).

On Linux x86-64 the toolchain runs natively and Docker is not needed.

## Build

```
./build.sh
```

`JIELI_TOOLCHAIN` and `AC79_SDK` override the default locations
(`~/.jieli/toolchain`, `~/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK`).

`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=<Unix time> ./build.sh` takes the build date on the ABOUT page from that UTC
time instead of the day of the build, so a rebuild is byte-identical (see docs/macos-development.md).

`python3 tools/build.py --gen-only` makes only the generated headers in `build/gen` (no toolchain,
Docker or SDK).

`./build.sh --release 0.9-beta` makes a release build: the package identity becomes
`FM-1_909` and the version string `0.9-BETA`; the package is `build/felucca-0.9-beta.fwsc`.

Build options (environment, `0` or `1`; defaults in `firmware/src/felucca.c`):

| Flag | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FELUCCA_FLASH` | 1 | settings, presets and projects in flash |
| `FELUCCA_OTA` | 1 | update entry (needs `FELUCCA_FLASH`) |
| `FELUCCA_CDC` | 1 | USB serial console |
| `FELUCCA_UART` | 0 | TRS MIDI IN (not tested on hardware) |
| `FELUCCA_WORLD` | 1 | Musical Worlds, PLAY MODE (`world.c`; [docs/worlds.md](docs/worlds.md)); 0 builds SLOOP alone |

## Samples

The CC0 instrument samples that the SAMPLE engine uses are in `assets/samples-cc0/`
(Versilian Studios, see `ATTRIBUTION.txt` there). `tools/fetch_cc0.py` downloads them
again from the source repositories. Without that folder the build still works and the
SAMPLE engine has only the generated drum kit.

## Tests

```
tests/run_tests.sh
```

Runs the host tests (flash storage, user presets, MIDI parser, update entry, update
loader, a DSP render, the 4-track mix, project formats, the SLICER, the regression suite,
the command-line installer) and, with Node.js, the web page tests. Run it after `./build.sh`
(it uses `build/` and needs `AC79_SDK` set as for the build).
`tests/run_tests.sh --host-only` needs no build: it skips the update entry, the update loader and
the target cost check. The groups that play each factory World play the four demo Worlds and two
more drawn from the library (`tests/world_sample.py`); `WORLDS=all tests/run_tests.sh` plays all
of them, `WORLDS="late_train magnetic"` the demo four and those.

The regression suite (`tests/regress.c`) renders every engine and preset and compares a
hash of each render with `tests/golden.txt`; it also checks levels, voices and the CPU
cost (`tests/cpu_baseline.txt`, `tests/target_budget.txt`). After an intended change of
the sound, `GOLDEN_UPDATE=1 sh tests/run_tests.sh` rewrites the hashes; `BUDGET_UPDATE=1`
does the same for the cost files.

## Install

On Windows, `INSTALL-SLOOP.bat` builds and opens the web installer (Chrome or Edge). The
`.fwsc` of each release is on the GitHub releases page.

From the command line (needs `pip3 install mido python-rtmidi`):

```
python3 tools/fm1_install.py build/felucca.fwsc
python3 tools/fm1_install.py --info          # identity of the connected FM-1
```

Or, to install your own build from the web installer, make a local copy of the site and open it from `localhost`
(Web MIDI needs a secure context):

```
python3 web/make_site.py build/felucca.fwsc dev /tmp/felucca-site
cd /tmp/felucca-site && python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/webapp/installer/
```

Installing firmware is at your own risk. If an install fails and the FM-1 no longer
starts, recovery needs [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter).
